        <h2><a name="workingcomp">1. Working with compressed files</a></h2>
        <p>Double Commander may work with compressed files just like it would be simple folders.</p>
        <p>For example if we have a ZIP file into a panel, we may simply select it, press <kbd>Enter</kbd> and panel will show the content of the ZIP just like if we would change to a directory.</p>
        <p>Double Commander is versatile enough to use external programs to deal with compressed files through it own interface. It uses two different principles to deal with the compressed files:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>through plugins;</li>
          <li>through exiting external archiver application controllable via command line.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>When we try to open an archive, Double Commander first checks the list of available packer plugins.</p>
        <p>Once "inside" the compressed file, we may do some minimal basic functions like viewing the file, copy it to the other panel and some limited function like that.</p>
        <p>The next following image shows us an example where we selected the compressed file "help.rar" and we simply press <kbd>Enter</kbd> in it just like it would be a directory:</p>
        <p class="figure"><img class="largeimage" title="View archive" alt="View archive" src="images/imgDC/archiveimg1.png" width="768" height="454"></p>
        <p>After calling the view (<kbd>F3</kbd>) or edit (<kbd>F4</kbd>) command, Double Commander will extract the file under the cursor to the system directory for the temporary files and open it. After closing the viewer, the temporary file will be deleted. If the file opened in the editor is changed, Double Commander will offer to pack it back (if the compressed file format and the packer plugin or external archiver support this feature).</p>
        <p>When using a double-click or pressing <kbd>Enter</kbd>, Double Commander will show the properties window of the packed file:</p>
        <p class="figure"><img class="largeimage" title="Properties of packed file" alt="Properties of packed file" src="images/imgDC/archiveimg27.png" width="268" height="316"></p>
        <p>The <span class="italic">Packer</span> line displays the name of the packer plugin used or the name of the external archiver.</p>
        <p>Buttons:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><p><span class="italic">Close</span>&nbsp;&ndash; will close the properties window.</p></li>
          <li><p><span class="italic">Unpack and execute</span>&nbsp;&ndash; Double Commander will extract the file under the cursor to the system directory for the temporary files and call the default action from <a href="configuration.html#ConfigAssociations">internal</a> or system file associations.</p></li>
          <li><p><span class="italic">Unpack all and execute</span>&nbsp;&ndash; like the previous one, but the entire contents of the archive will be extracted first.</p></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Double Commander allows to configure the automatic opening of file in the associated program directly, use <a href="configxml.html">&lt;AutoExtractOpenMask&gt;</a>.</p>
        <p>When closing, Double Commander deletes all temporary files.</p>

      <div>
        <h2><a name="withplugin">2. Working with plugins</a></h2>
        <p>We may configure Double Commander to use an external "packer plugin" files that will help to deal with a compressed archive.</p>
        <p>Right from the installation, Double Commander already incorporates <a href="plugins.html#wcx">some</a> of these .WCX plugin files.</p>
        <p>Also, there are few others one on the web. We may just search for .WCX plugins.</p>
        <p>Also remember that the ones made to work with Total Commander should also basically work with Double Commander.</p>
        <br>
        <p>To install, enable the usage of them or to configure them, we'll need to access Configuration&nbsp;&gt; Options...&nbsp;&gt; Plugins&nbsp;&gt; Plugins WCX:</p>
        <p class="figure"><img class="largeimage" title="Configuration&nbsp;&gt; Plugins WCX" alt="Configuration&nbsp;&gt; Plugins WCX" src="images/imgDC/archiveimg2.png" width="694" height="380"></p>

      <div>
        <h2><a name="archivers">3. Working with external archivers</a></h2>
        <p>Sometimes the plugin for the type of file archive we want to use does not exist.</p>
        <p>Or for whatever raison, sometimes it might happen we would want explicitly use an external packer to use the benefit of a feature or something not present in the pseudo equivalent plugin.</p>
        <p>Double Commander uses principle of the work with external archivers similar to plugin <a href="http://wcx.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank">MultiArc</a> for Total Commander.</p>
        <p>Just to make things clear, <b>using an external archiver may be summarized as this: it's a way to launch the archiver we may be familiar with but to have it driven by Double Commander, by providing to the archiver executable the various parameters we would need to make it like integrated into the application</b>.</p>
        <p>The remaining of this page will be on this matter: how to configure Double Commander to launch the external archiver to do whatever we need with it.</p>
        <p>Let's suppose we want to use "rar.exe" to deal with .rar archive.</p>
        <p>As we may guess it, the basic things <b>we'll need to configure are how call the external archiver to be able to...</b></p>
        <ul>
          <li>get the list of content of a given archive file;</li>
          <li>extract;</li>
          <li>add one file or a list of file to a given or to-be-created archive file;</li>
          <li>extract one file or a list of file from an archive file.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This will be done by doing Configuration Options Archiver as illustrated below:</p>
        <p class="figure"><img class="largeimage" title="Configuration&nbsp;&gt; Archivers" alt="Configuration&nbsp;&gt; Archivers" src="images/imgDC/archiveimg3.png" width="756" height="571"></p>
        <p>All settings are stored in the <tt>multiarc.ini</tt> file.</p>
        <p>Let's see in the following sections the versatile possibilities Double Commander offers us to properly integrate the usage of an external packer.</p>
        <p class="navback"><a href="#topofpage">(back to top)</a></p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h2><a name="config">4. Configuring external archivers integration</a></h2>
        <p>We won't describe here each and every fields since once we've started it will be pretty straight forward, but we'll spend time to properly described an example of integration.</p>
        <p>We'll describe the integration of the "rar.exe" external archiver. There is nothing better than a complete step by step example.</p>
        <p class="navback"><a href="#topofpage">(back to top)</a></p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h2><a name="addingnew">4.1. Adding a new external archiver</a></h2>
        <p>We click the "Add" button at the bottom, we give a significant name to appear in the list of archiver and then we'll be ready to configure it.</p>
        <p class="figure"><img class="largeimage" title="Add a new external archiver" alt="Add a new external archiver" src="images/imgDC/archiveimg4.png" width="604" height="395"></p>
        <br>
        <p>We then need to indicate us a significant description for the archiver, the exact location where is the executable of the archiver and then associated file extension, without the period, to that archiver.</p>
        <p>If we have more than one possible, just add them with a single comma between each one, no space.</p>
        <p class="figure"><img class="largeimage" title="Add a new external archiver" alt="Add a new external archiver" src="images/imgDC/archiveimg5.png" width="570" height="211"></p>
        <p>Note: Double Commander supports double extensions (for example, "tar.gz", "tar.xz" and so on), they must be placed in the beginning of the list of extensions (i.e. "tar.gz" before "gz").</p>

        <h2><a name="variables">4.2. Variables to interface with external archiver</a></h2>
        <p>As mentioned earlier, we'll need to configure how to invoke our external archiver executable to do what we want.</p>
        <p>To help us to do so, Double Commander offer us numerous dedicated variable to fill the configuration string for the various action we may configure.</p>
        <p>Here follows a table showing the variable that can be used and what will be substituted for it:</p>

      <div>
        <h2><a name="actionlist">4.4. Configuring the "List" action</a></h2>
        <p>If we want Double Commander to work with the compressed archive file like it would be a directory containing files, we need to be able to get the list of file that the archive has.</p>
        <p>At this point, we don't need to uncompress! No, it's just a matter of doing the list of what it contains so Double Commander will show the content to us.</p>
        <p>In our example with "rar.exe", it we look at the documentation of it, thre is the "v" command that allow us to get the console application "rar.exe" to give out the list of files inside the archive:</p>
        <p class="figure"><img class="largeimage" title="rar.exe: launch options" alt="rar.exe: launch options" src="images/imgDC/archiveimg6.png" width="568" height="139"></p>
        <br>
        <p>So following the usage of the application, to get the list of what's inside the RAR archive, we need to call the "rar.exe" with parameters with the "v" command and then the archive name.</p>
        <p>Let's test this manually first by attempting to show the content of a file like "E:\Temp\just.rar"</p>
        <p class="figure"><img class="largeimage" title="rar.exe: getting a list of files in the terminal" alt="rar.exe: getting a list of files in the terminal" src="images/imgDC/archiveimg7.png" width="800" height="630"></p>
        <br>
        <p>So what we need now to do is to configure the "list" to tell to Double Commander how to invoke "rar.exe" to get the content of the compressed archive.</p>
        <p>To do that, we'll rewrite the same thing as what we've just did but by using the variable and variable modifier mentioned earlier.</p>
        <p>Here is what's it looks like:</p>
        <p class="figure"><img class="largeimage" title="Action: List" alt="Action: List" src="images/imgDC/archiveimg8.png" width="86" height="41"></p>
        <p>We wrote <code>%P v %AQ</code> using the variable mentioned earlier with the Variable and Variable Modifier.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><code>%P</code> will be substituted by our executable written earlier, so "E:\Program Files\WinRAR\Rar.exe".</li>
          <li><code>v</code> will remain as is and is the "v" command or the "rar.exe" external archiver to view list of files.</li>
          <li><code>%A</code> is the name of the archive, we add to it the <code>Q</code> to indicate we want Double Commander to quote the name if there is space in it.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>So all this is to invoke the external archiver with proper parameters.</p>
        <p>This will be use when we use the internal command <a href="cmds.html#cm_OpenArchive">cm_OpenArchive</a>.</p>
        <p>A few words about the "Use archive name without extension as list" option: This option is intended for archives that can contain only one file and the filename is equal to the archive name without extension (Bzip2, XZ and others). Such compressed files usually do not contain the name of the original file.</p>
        <p class="navback"><a href="#topofpage">(back to top)</a></p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h2><a name="recuperate">4.5. Recuperating list of content</a></h2>
        <p>So far what we've done will have the archiver to output the list of the files inside the archive files.</p>
        <p>But now that's not all! We need to recuperate this outputted data and display it in our panel.</p>
        <p>So we need Double Commander to interpret that output table we've that the command of the archiver will output.</p>
        <p class="navback"><a href="#topofpage">(back to top)</a></p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h2><a name="delimit">4.5.1. Delimiting the area to analyse</a></h2>
        <p>As we see in previous capture, the output of the "rar.exe" regarding the content is not just bare data.</p>
        <p>There are some annoying information around we need to eliminate to keep only the actual file list.</p>
        <p>Luckily, we may configure a magic string so Double Commander will wait to see that string prior to begin to parse the next following lines.</p>
        <p>Also, we may configure the magic string to stop parsing as well.</p>
        <p>Because we have dashed line before and after, it's pretty easy to set these two parameters with the dashed lines:</p>
        <p class="figure"><img class="largeimage" title="Action: Listing start/finish" alt="Action: Listing start/finish" src="images/imgDC/archiveimg9.png" width="360" height="79"></p>
        <p>In the eventuality that an external archive would immediately output bar data with no extra lines, simply let the two fields empty.</p>
        <p>The caret ("^") is a there to indicate that the magic string needs absolutely to start the line, with nothing else.</p>
        <p>If it would not be possible to be sure it starts the line, like for example if the external archiver would start the line with the date and time, and then a constant string, we would set the magic string to be the constant string but we would not add the caret which instruct to Double Commander that the string to search might be anywhere.</p>
        <p>If the "Listing finish" string might be confused with a filename, it could stop processing the content of the archive too early.</p>
        <p>That's why, when possible, it's good to specify that the string must start the line.</p>
        <p>Also, if there is a way to set the "Listing finish" string as long as possible, still being constant, it's even better and safe to make sure no confusion will happen in the future.</p>
        <p class="navback"><a href="#topofpage">(back to top)</a></p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h2><a name="parsing">4.5.2. Parsing the list of content</a></h2>
        <p>Now Double Commander knows exactly which data to parse to get the file list of the archive file.</p>
        <p>It would have been easy to hard coded in the application a routine to parse that "RAR" output to get the file list.</p>
        <p>But Double Commander does not do that.</p>
        <p>Instead, it is extremely versatile by giving us the opportunity to configure ourself the way the table will be parsed!</p>
        <p>It might be a little bit more complex than having nothing to do, but on the other hand, it gives us maximum of flexibility by being able to use external archival Double Commander developers were not even aware of!</p>
        <p>To help us to parse that output table the archiver is giving us, we will have various expression representing by letters.</p>

        <h2><a name="standardexample">4.5.4. Example with standard syntax</a></h2>
        <p>So the beauty of the thing here is to use the available expressions from the previous table to write the "Listing format" string that will configure Double Commander for that external archiver so it will be able to get the content of the archive concerning directory and filenames, filesize, attributes, file dates, etc.</p>
        <p>First guess for us to help to generate that line would be to write in Notepad for example a line of text for one file we've done manually previously and write below that expression from the previous table that would fit.</p>
        <p>Here is an example of that:</p>
        <p class="figure"><img class="largeimage" title="Listing format: example with standard syntax" alt="Listing format: example with standard syntax" src="images/imgDC/archiveimg10.png" width="818" height="150"></p>
        <p>So as we can see, we wrote the parsing expression letter matching to each field at the same exact position where it is located into the output of the archive content that our external archiver outputed us:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>series of "a" for where is the file attributes;</li>
          <li>series of "z" for where is the uncompressed size of files;</li>
          <li>the date and times letters for the date and time of files;</li>
          <li>series of "n", more than enough, for where is the actual filenames.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>So configured that way, if we select our previous "just.rar" archive into a panel, we press <kbd>Enter</kbd> to get into it like it would be a directory, we see the file content showing us what we did "basically" worked (if we ignore the last file...):</p>

        <h2><a name="advancedexample">4.5.6. Example with advanced syntax</a></h2>
        <p>The example with the "standard syntax" was a good guess, but it is perfect.</p>
        <p>There are some cases where it won't work correctly.</p>
        <p>With huge files, the filesize is wider than expected so our first attempt of listing will fail.</p>
        <p>See our file <code>007 Skyfall.TS</code>.</p>
        <p>We can see it is not displayed with the appropriate information. Let's compare:</p>
        <p class="figure"><img class="largeimage" title="View archive: appropriate information" alt="View archive: appropriate information" src="images/imgDC/archiveimg12.png" width="756" height="122"></p>
        <p>So we see it's incorrect regarding the filename, file size, the date, etc.</p>
        <p>Let's use elements from the "advanced syntax" to solve this problematic situation.</p>
        <p>Here is what could be use to make it work even if outputed field are not *exactly* always on the same width:</p>
        <p class="figure"><img class="largeimage" title="Listing format" alt="Listing format" src="images/imgDC/archiveimg13.png" width="258" height="41"></p>
        <p>It's a little more complex, but is very easy to described and at the end we'll see it's not so complicated to generate.</p>
        <p>Here's a colored description that will help us to visualize the parsing of each little block:</p>
        <p class="figure"><img class="largeimage" title="Listing format: example with advanced syntax" alt="Listing format: example with advanced syntax" src="images/imgDC/archiveimg14.png" width="748" height="495"></p>
        <p>So using that "listing format" string, we may now do again our test and we have the correct result, even for the huge file:</p>

        <h2><a name="configids">4.12. Configuring the "ID's"</a></h2>
        <p>We may configure Double Commander in such way that it will ignore file extension of a file and attempt to detect a compressed file archive by it's internal content and then invoke the appropriate list and unpack commands described above.</p>
        <p>This is where we will use the internal command <a href="cmds.html#cm_OpenArchive">cm_OpenArchive</a>.</p>
        <p>Example of the usage of this is when we want to see the actual content of a self-extracted .exe file without having to launch it.</p>
        <p>Another example would be to see the content of archive that is saved with a different file extension than the regular archive like the .docx file of Microsoft Word which in fact actually a compressed ZIP file.</p>
        <p>Basically we may configure Double Commander to detect the presence of strategic pattern of data at specific location into selected file so it will recognize the configured archived.</p>
        <p>We will call "ID's" these patterns and this section is about configuration of them.</p>
        <p>We have three settings for that: ID, ID Position and ID Seek Range.</p>
        <p>We will instruct Double Commander where to search for specific ID's pattern to recognize an a type of archive and then use the configured commands specific to the recognized type of archive.</p>
        <p>Let's begin by a simple example. Here follows a snapshot of the beginning of a 7-Zip archive:</p>
        <p class="figure"><img class="largeimage" title="Sample 7-Zip file" alt="Sample 7-Zip file" src="images/imgDC/archiveimg25.png" width="608" height="122"></p>
        <p>By looking at other 7-Zip files, we see that the first six bytes are always the sequence 0x37 0x7A 0xBC 0xAF 0x27 0x1C.</p>
        <p>So we will take profit of that by configuring Double Commander that when it sees a file starting with that sequence to assume that the file is an 7-Zip archive.</p>
        <p>That's what we do with the following configuration:</p>
        <p class="figure"><img class="largeimage" title="7-Zip ID" alt="7-Zip ID" src="images/imgDC/archiveimg26.png" width="130" height="121"></p>
        <p>We must write ID as a 2-digit hex numbers delimited with spaces.</p>
        <p>ID Position (optional) is a position of ID in archive. If not present, ID will be searched in the beginning of archive. We can define the positions with "-" sign: in this case the positions will be calculated from the end of file. Special value &lt;SeekID&gt; determinated search ID if not found by numeric values of ID Position. Seek in range "0 .. size of file" or "0 .. ID Seek Range". Values can be writed as decimal (12345) or hexadecimal (0x3039). For negative values use notation 0xFFFFFFFF (-1).</p>
        <p>ID Seek Range (optional) is a count of bytes where ID seek if defined &lt;SeekID&gt;. By default it's 1 MB.</p>
        <p><b>Note:</b> All above parameters can be defined with multiple values. We can use comma to separate those multiple values.</p>
        <p>In our example with 7-Zip archive, ID and ID Position (0, because in the beginning of file) will be enough.</p>
        <p>So when we invoke internal command <a href="cmds.html#cm_OpenArchive">cm_OpenArchive</a>, Double Commander will scan content of the file and it recognize the "0x37 0x7A 0xBC 0xAF 0x27 0x1C" pattern at offset 0 in the file, it will process it as it is our configured 7Z type of file and then use the associated configured commands and parameters for listing, extract, etc.</p>
        <p>In most cases, there is no need to examine files in hexadecimal representation: the file signature can be found in the format specification or use existing lists, databases or utilities (for example, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_file_signatures" target="_blank">this Wikipedia page</a> or <a href="https://freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/shared-mime-info/" target="_blank">FreeDesktop.org MIME database</a>).</p>

        <h2><a name="debug">4.13. Debugging</a></h2>
        <p>The steps described above are usually sufficient to use an external archiver, but just in case we have a couple more options:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><p><span class="italic">Show console output</span>&nbsp;&ndash; If enabled, Double Commander will write (line by line) the result of the work of the external archiver and parser to the log window.</p></li>
          <li><p><span class="italic">Debug mode</span>&nbsp;&ndash; Similar to the previous option, but the result of the work will also be output to the Double Commander's debugging messages (see the description of <a href="commandline.html">--debug-log</a>). In this case, the temporary file with the list of files (<code>%L</code> in our example) will not be automatically deleted after the operation is completed.</p></li>
        </ul>
        <p>If the display of the log window is disabled in the <a href="configuration.html#ConfigLayout">settings</a>, it will be shown forcibly and hidden when Double Commander is closed. Messages will not be saved to the log file.</p>

        <p>This menu contains several additional functions:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><p><span class="italic">Auto Configure</span>&nbsp;&ndash; Double Commander will check all executable files of archivers: if a file is found, the program will automatically add its full path and enable the archiver, otherwise the archiver will be disabled.</p></li>
          <li><p><span class="italic">Discard modifications</span>&nbsp;&ndash; resets all unsaved settings changes.</p></li>
          <li><p><span class="italic">Sort archivers</span>&nbsp;&ndash; sorts the list of archivers alphabetically.</p></li>
          <li><p><span class="italic">Disable all</span> and <span class="italic">Enable all</span>&nbsp;&ndash; enable or disable all archivers.</p></li>
          <li><p><span class="italic">Export...</span> and <span class="italic">Import...</span>&nbsp;&ndash; allow us to export and import archiver settings (all archivers or part of them).</p></li>

        <h2><a name="openassociation">5. Opening an archive file in an associated application</a></h2>
        <p>By default, files whose extensions are specified in the settings of WCX plugins and external archivers are opened as folders. To open them in an associated application, we can use the "Open" item in the <a href="help.html#cm_ContextMenu">context menu</a> of the file (but in this case only system file associations will be used) or we can add the desired action to the "Actions" menu.</p>
        <p>To use the <kbd>Enter</kbd> key or double-click, we have to change the settings.</p>
        <p>We can just remove the extension from the settings, but in this case the commands <a href="cmds.html#cm_OpenArchive">cm_OpenArchive</a> and <a href="cmds.html#cm_ExtractFiles">cm_ExtractFiles</a> will become unavailable. Another way:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><p>If a WCX plugin is used, then we can open the plugin settings, select the extension and enable the "Show as normal files (hide packer icon)" flag.</p></li>
          <li><p>If an external archiver is used to unpack files, then we can fill in the fields for using ID and not specify the file extension.</p></li>
        </ul>
        <p>For such files, Double Commander will use the associated icon instead of the generic archive icon.</p>
