This file contains general instructions and convention about HTML help file of DC.
==================================================================================

-When using a link to something external to Double Commander help, set the target to be a new window using target="_blank" like in this example:
  <a title="Double Commander" href="http://doublecmd.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank">Homepage</a>

-To be more friendly with the user, to make us as the same level as the user, let's talk using "WE" instead of "YOU".
 The user will feel that we're working together.

-DO NOT USE POINT NUMBER IN HTML FILENAME.
 Just name the file based on what it describes and assume we will not rename it.
 Even if today "findfiles.html" has point 2.2, it does not mean it will always be 2.2.
 But it will always be talking about finding files.
 Keeping reference pointing "findfiles.html" will always be true...
 ...which would not be the case if we would have point to something like "sec2_2_findfiles.html" for example.
 Keep the section numbers for the *test* inside page and NEVER INSIDE A LINK.
